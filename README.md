# Vehicle-Showroom-Management
Hello fellow Coding Enthusiasts!
This Project is made in Java programming language.
It entails use of concepts like Exception handling, Collection Framework(List) - its readymade methods and sort method.
It also uses menu-driven code block to interact with the users.
While doing the project, I got to revise the basics of Java (OOP concepts and deeper understanding of Hierarchial inheritance).
Hope you find it interesting and knowledgeable.
